# Welcome to my R Portfolio

## Hi, my name is Cara

I am from Hershey, PA (land of chocolate and cows) and currently located in Washington D.C. I am in my last year of undergrad at the George Washington University studying Theatre and Journalism, with a focus on directing and producing stories in a dynamic and compelling way. I am currently working on a thesis performance that examines human's relationships with artificial intelligence. In my free time you can find me doting on my pet cats, reviewing movies on Letterboxd, or looking for good vegetarian food in D.C.

### Biden Transition Flexdashboard 

For this assignment, I created a functional mini site using Flexdashboard that showcases the data from the previous Biden Transition project. This site shows the number of appointees on Biden Transition Agency Review Teams (arranged from largest to smallest), the names of new appointees, and picks out the largest and smallest teams at this time. My hope is that this site could allow viewers to easily understand what teams are largest (and may be recieving more attention/ funding) and which are smallest (less attention/ funding).
