# Welcome to my R Portfolio

## Hi, my name is Cara

I am from Hershey, PA (land of chocolate and cows) and currently located in Washington D.C. I am in my last year of undergrad at the George Washington University studying Theatre and Journalism, with a focus on directing and producing stories in a dynamic and compelling way. I am currently working on a thesis performance that examines human's relationships with artificial intelligence. In my free time you can find me doting on my pet cats, reviewing movies on Letterboxd, or looking for good vegetarian food in D.C.
